// instruction
    // First, use console.log to log the output variable.
    //  Then, use console.clear to clear the browser console.

// note
    // Note: console.logs inside functions are printed to the freeCodeCamp console whenever those functions are called. 
    // This can help debugging functions that are called during testing.


    // Open your browser console.
let output = "Get this to log once in the freeCodeCamp console and twice in the browser console";
// Use console.log() to print the output variable.

// Run the tests to see the difference between the two consoles.

// Now, add console.clear() before your console.log() to clear the browser console, and pass the tests.
