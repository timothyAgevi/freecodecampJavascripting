// instruction
    // Add two console.log() statements to check the typeof 
    //   each of the two variables seven and three in the code.

 //notes
    // JavaScript recognizes six primitive (immutable) data types: 
    // Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, String, and Symbol(new with ES6)
    //  and one type for mutable items: Object. 
    // Note that in JavaScript, arrays are technically a type of object.
